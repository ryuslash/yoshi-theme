* COMMENT [[https://github.com/ryuslash/yoshi-theme/compare/v6.2.0...HEAD][Unreleased]]

** ADDED Colors and variables for ivy-posframe

   Add the ivy-posframe faces: ~ivy-posframe~, ~ivy-posframe-border~. And variables:
   ~ivy-posframe-border-width~, ~ivy-posframe-style~.

** ADDED Variables for hydra-posframe

   Add the hydra-posframe: ~hydra-posframe-show-params~.

** ADDED Colors and variables for flycheck-posframe

   Add the flycheck-posframe faces: ~flycheck-posframe-background-face~,
   ~flycheck-posframe-border-face~. And variables: ~flycheck-posframe-border-width~.

** CHANGED the background colors of org blocks

   Instead of showing an underline and an overline for the beginning and end
   blocks, give them a background color. With the variable
   =org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line= set to =t=, this causes it to create a
   line-thick border at the top of the block. The background of the block itself
   has been changed to match that of other highlighted backgrounds, such as the
   posframe pop-ups for ivy and company. The bottom line has been given the same
   color so that blocks don't look too busy all over your document.

** ADDED the setting to fontify whole block delimiter lines

   With =org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line= set to =t= the org block colors
   have a better appearance.

** ADDED Some ediff faces

   Add the ediff faces: =ediff-even-diff-A=, =ediff-even-diff-B=, =ediff-odd-diff-A=,
   and =ediff-odd-diff-B=.

** ADDED fill-column-indicator face

Add the face =fill-column-indicator=.

** ADDED A couple of cider faces

Add the cider faces: ~cider-test-success-face~ and ~cider-test-failure-face~.

** ADDED Some org-mode faces

Add the =org-code=, =org-verbatim=, =org-document-info-keyword=, =org-meta-line=, =org-document-info=, and =org-table= faces.

** CHANGED All the gray faces

Change all the gray faces to provide a little bit more flexibility in which colors I can use and allow for more distinctive use of certain colors.

This is inspired by ideas from the [[https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes][Nord theme Colors and Palettes]].

** CHANGED mode-line faces

I hope that these changes make the mode-line more distinctive and nicer to look at. I wanted to use one of the new colors after reading some of the [[https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes][Nord theme Colors and Palettes]] notes about the use of their colors for different “levels” of UI elements. I thought this worked quite well with the mode-line and some of the other elements such as hydras as well.

** CHANGED org-block face

Made =org-block= inherit from the =fixed-pitch= face so that when =variable-pitch-mode= is used for Org mode, code in code blocks are still using monospaced fonts.

** ADDED Some tab bar faces

Add the =tab-bar=, =tab-bar-tab=, and =tab-bar-tab-inactive= faces.

** ADDED A notmuch face

Add the =notmuch-message-summary-face=.

** FIXED Diff refine changed face name

=diff-refine-change= doesn't exist, it's =diff-refine-changed=.

   respectively. Also give the =org-level-1= and =org-level-2= some
   extra height.
