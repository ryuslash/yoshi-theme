* Yoshi theme

My cat is named Yoshi and I was just working on a random new theme, which was =new-theme= for a while. I couldn't think of a name so I named it after him.

** Installation

Installation comes in two flavors.

*** Installation with ELPA

To install Yoshi theme using the built-in Emacs package manager you should have [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]] or [[https://marmalade-repo.org/][Marmalade]] in your =package-archives= list. When that's ready you can =M-x list-packages=, find =yoshi-theme=, press =i= and =x= and you're done.

*** Installation from git

To use a version from the latest git checkout you should clone the repository and then add the directory to your =custom-theme-load-path=.

In a shell execute:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  cd ~/
  git clone git://github.com/ryuslash/yoshi-theme.git
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then add to your =~/.emacs.d/init.el=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path (expand-file-name "~/yoshi-theme"))
#+END_SRC

** Enabling Yoshi theme

Once you've installed Yoshi theme you can either use =M-x load-theme= to enable it interactively for the current session, or put the following in your =~/.emacs.d/init.el=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (load-theme 'yoshi :no-confirm)
#+END_SRC

*** Other modules

- yoshi-mode-line :: Enable this by calling ~(require 'yoshi-mode-line)~. This module enables the mode-line as is intended to be used with Yoshi theme.

** Installation in Spacemacs

Edit your .spacemacs file ~(SPC f e d)~ and add the ~yoshi-theme~ package:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  dotspacemacs-additional-packages '(yoshi-theme)
#+END_SRC

Add the theme to the top of the themes list to make it the default theme, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  dotspacemacs-themes '(yoshi
                        monokai
                        spacemacs-dark
                        spacemacs-light
                        solarized-light
                        solarized-dark
                        leuven
                        zenburn)
#+END_SRC
