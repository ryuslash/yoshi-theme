* Yoshi theme

  My cat is named Yoshi and I was just working on a random new theme,
  which was =new-theme= for a while.  I couldn't think of a name so I
  named it after him.

** Installation

   Installation comes in two flavors.

*** Installation with ELPA

    To install Yoshi theme using the built-in Emacs package
    manager you should have [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]]
    or [[https://marmalade-repo.org/][Marmalade]] in your
    =package-archives= list. When that's ready you can
    =M-x list-packages=, find =yoshi-theme=, press =i= and =x=
    and you're done.

*** Installation from git

    To use a version from the latest git checkout you should clone the
    repository and then add the directory to your
    =custom-theme-load-path=.

    In a shell execute:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    cd ~/
    git clone git://github.com/ryuslash/yoshi-theme.git
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    Then add to your =~/.emacs.d/init.el=:

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path (expand-file-name "~/yoshi-theme"))
    #+END_SRC

** Enabling Yoshi theme

   Once you've installed Yoshi theme you can either use =M-x
   load-theme= to enable it interactively for the current session, or
   put the following in your =~/.emacs.d/init.el=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (load-theme 'yoshi :no-confirm)
   #+END_SRC

** Installation in Spacemacs

   Edit your .spacemacs file ~(SPC f e d)~ and add the ~yoshi-theme~
   package:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     dotspacemacs-additional-packages '(yoshi-theme)
   #+END_SRC

   Add the theme to the top of the themes list to make it the default
   theme, for example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     dotspacemacs-themes '(yoshi
                           monokai
                           spacemacs-dark
                           spacemacs-light
                           solarized-light
                           solarized-dark
                           leuven
                           zenburn)
   #+END_SRC
